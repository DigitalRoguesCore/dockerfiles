# Dockerfiles

Little experiment using Docker and minimal containers to organize **my**
development machine (and perhaps help others).

## Motivation

Find myself switching machines, OS, distros and even *shells* when working
on projects with different developers.

This forces me to cover all those differences on each project's `README` to
avoid wasting time.

While I could workout a multi-package manager that install those dependencies
on each target OS, I will still need to figure out specifics.

What if I can package the desired services, orchestrate them somehow and
provide cleaner instructions to my fellow developers (and to myself six
months from now).
